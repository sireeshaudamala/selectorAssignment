Hello folks, this time your goal is to create a visually appealing call-to-action card demonstrating your HTML and CSS skills that you have gained so far. This exercise will focus on structuring content with HTML and styling it effectively using CSS, while ensuring proper alignment, typography, and spacing.

- Button color: #4184e1
- Text color: rgba(0,0,0,1) --> With variations of alpha values

The assignment is not structure heavy, so don't over spend time on structuring and no nested structures. The style duplication should not happen now that you know selectors and style tag.
